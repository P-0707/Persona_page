        <p>
            I have successfully completed the <strong>"Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python"</strong> course offered by <strong>IBM</strong> on the Coursera platform through <strong>Infosys Springboard</strong>. This intensive program provided a comprehensive understanding of <strong>database management</strong> and <strong>SQL techniques</strong> essential for data science.

            <br><br>

            The course covered a wide range of topics, including:

            <br><br>
            
            - <strong>Analyzing data within a database using SQL and Python</strong>. <br>
            - <strong>Creating relational databases</strong> and managing multiple tables with <strong>Data Definition Language (DDL)</strong> commands. <br>
            - <strong>Constructing basic to intermediate SQL queries</strong> with <strong>Data Manipulation Language (DML)</strong> commands. <br>
            - <strong>Composing advanced queries</strong> utilizing techniques such as views, transactions, stored procedures, and joins.

            <br><br>

            Throughout the course, I gained hands-on experience with various tools and techniques, including <strong>Python programming, cloud databases, and relational database management systems (RDBMS)</strong>. I also worked extensively with SQL and Jupyter notebooks, reinforcing my learning through practical application and real-world scenarios. This program enhanced my skills in <strong>data analysis, database design, and advanced SQL querying</strong>, equipping me with the expertise needed to handle complex data challenges effectively.
